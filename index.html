        <h2> 
        The Monty Hall problem is a brain teaser, in the form of a probability puzzle, based nominally on the American television game show 
        Let's Make a Deal and named after its original host, Monty Hall. The problem was originally posed (and solved) in a letter by Steve Selvin 
        to the American Statistician in 1975. It became famous as a question from reader Craig F. Whitaker's letter quoted in Marilyn vos 
        Savant's "Ask Marilyn" column in Parade magazine in 1990.

        <h2>The optimal strategy</h2>
        <body>The optimal strategy for the Monty Hall problem is to always switch doors after the host reveals a goat behind one of the other two 
            doors. This approach stems from the counterintuitive nature of the problem's probabilities. Initially, the chance of picking the car (the winning prize) behind one of the three doors is 1/3, while the probability that the car is behind one of the two doors you did not choose is 2/3. When the host, who knows where the car is, opens one of the doors you did not pick to reveal a goat, the probability does not split equally between the two remaining doors. Instead, the chance of the car being behind the initially chosen door remains at 1/3, while the probability that the car is behind the other unopened door (the one you have the option to switch to) jumps to 2/3. By switching, you effectively take advantage of the higher probability, doubling your chances of winning the car from 1/3 to 2/3.</body>
